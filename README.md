Developed a scalable file compression application using Node.js and bzip2 compression. Utilized AWS services including EC2 instances, S3 storage, and SQS for load balancing. Implemented automated scaling based on CPU utilization for efficient resource allocation. Ensured data persistence with Redis cache and S3 storage for compressed files.
